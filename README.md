# Sentiment-Score
Please propose a formula that calculates a sentiment score. The sentiment score should satisfy the following requirements:
- The result of the formula is ONE number for each topic for each day
- The number indicates how positive or negative a topic is perceived on a particular day
- The number allows to compare the sentiment about one company at different days (e.g. is the company AXA perceived more positively today than yesterday?)
- The number allows to compare the sentiment about two different companies (e.g. is the company AIG seen more positive than the company AXA today?)
- The number allows to compare the sentiment about companies that have many messages per day (e.g. ReneSola Ltd.) with companies that have few messages per day (e.g. IBM)
